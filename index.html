                <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
                <p>An analytical and passionate Game Designer with a lifelong dedication to TCGs and the League of Legends universe, blending the insight of a high-level competitive player with the technical skill of a developer. With a degree in Information Systems  and hands-on experience in game development with Unity, I am eager to apply nearly two decades of studying card game systems and metagames to contribute to the design and success of Riot Games' new TCG. My journey, which began at age 6 with TCGs and at 12 with League of Legends, culminates in the desire to build a game as impactful for the next generation of players as Riot's games have been for me.</p>
